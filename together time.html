<p>A dog feeding schedule is not the only thing you should establish.Together time is a bonding experience for you and your dog.</p>
<p>Today our lives are busier than ever, and it seems like we have less time for important things, like spending quality time with our dogs.</p><br>

<p>And guess what? It’s statistically true.</p><br>

<p>According to The Book of Times: From Seconds to Centuries, a Compendium of Measures, pet owners spend only 40 minutes a day with their dogs. A measly 40 minutes!</p><br>

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no way to add hours to the day. But there are many creative ways you can carve out more time with your pup. Here are our some favourites:</p><br><br>
<p><b><span style="color:red">*</span></b>Go to pet-friendly stores together. Got to run errands? Go to pet-friendly places and bring your dog along.<br><br>

<b><span style="color:red;font-size:14pt">*</span></b>Schedule playdates. Having a tough time making time just for your dog? try remembering them.<br><br>

<b><span style="color:red;font-size:14pt">*</b>Explore together. Check out local outdoor sites you’ve always wanted to see and bring your dog with. Maybe it’s a cool park, or a river.<br><br>
<b><span style="color:red;font-size:14pt">*</b>Involve them in outside chores. If you’re a homeowner, we can guess how you spend a big part of your weekend: doing yard work. Mowing the lawn etc.<br><br>

<b><span style="color:red;font-size:14pt">*</b>Go to a pet event. Feeling like you need to get out of the house and do something? Go to a pet event and bring you pup with.<br><br>


<b><span style="color:red;font-size:14pt">*</b>Make grooming a bonding experience. Being a dog parent comes with certain grooming duties like baths, brushings, cleaning teeth, cleaning ears, trimming nails, etc.<br><br>

<b><span style="color:red;font-size:14pt">*</b>Snuggle up. Do you ever just sit and watch TV or read a book? I’m guessing you just said yes. So, when you’re doing this, call your dog over and invite them in your lap for a little snuggle time.<br><br>

<b><span style="color:red;font-size:14pt">*</b>Bring your dog to outdoor events. Going to watch your nephew’s soccer game or cheering on your friend at their 5K? Bring your pup with!<br><br>
